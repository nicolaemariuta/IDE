I am considering that after I finish this course, I can continue a project that I have done for my Bachelor Thesis for which I processed the audio signal of a collection of songs and obtained a collection of parameters that could help me to group the songs according to their genre.
I had a collection with 300 songs from 6 genres: rock, classical, jazz, disco, country and hip-hop. For a classification algorithm like knn, the parameters had a quite good accuracy, around 70%. I used the resulting parameters for making a "smart music player" that is automatically picking
the next song to b played by using k-nearest neighbour. I was even then thinking to have a way to visualise the placement of the songs in space according to the similarity of their parameters and used a tool RapidMiner that had implemented the Kohonen Maps algorithm that is mapping n-dimensional items to 2d
or whatever dimensionality by approximately preserving the Euclidean distance between the items. I obtained a map much like this: <img>
Now I would like to improve my musical player and somehow display an Interactive Self Organising Map either as desktop application or maybe even on a webpage associated with the application. As it can be seen in the image above, we can see the genre of song that is at a specific location but I would like to
make an interactive map that will also show me details about the song like the name, the author when I click or hover above it. I would also like to maybe see the songs that are chosen by knn to play next. Now that I have seen something similar at the lecture, I am also thinking to maybe, when I click the region
with songs of a specific genre, to also see a split into subgenres of those songs. 
Such an improvement to my project can have two types of targets: first of all, it will help me to see the correlation between parameters obtained from audio signal processing of songs based on frequency or other characteristics of audio signal and the genres classification. Since I obtained quite good performance with little refined algorithm,
some improvement will certainly increase the accuracy of making an automatic classification into genres and also accuracy of music player of choosing the next song with similar genre. Secondly, such visualisation will also be great for possible users of the application since they will have an awesome view of their collection of songs and 
it will maybe have an use similar to famous Shazam application but this time for getting an interesting placing in genre for new songs that are developed.
There are many sources online to get songs in mp3 format and I am thinking that maybe I can also make into a larger application to have a website and users use their local machines to process the songs on their machines by using the algorithm as I implemented and then to upload the results on a common server and then their new entries would appear
in a big SOM that can be viewed by all users of the application or website. By doing this, people can maybe get a guess of the genre of a new song if they doubt about its classification.
