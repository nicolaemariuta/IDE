      <h2>Hand Measurements</h2>
      <p>A dataset with 40 hands, is displayed in a scatter plot and a graph outline of the hands. The scatterplot show all the hands, plotted onto the first two principal components. The graph show each hand individually. Click on a point in the scatterplot, to see the outline of the corresponding hand.</p>
	  
	 
<p>The hands data, has 112 coordinate points, 56 x-coordinates and 56 y-coordinates. The hand outline it plotted directly from these values.</p>
<p>The principal component coordinate system, is based on the data variance, such that the first principal component correspond to the direction in the original spatial coordinate system with the most variance. The data is mapped onto the principal component space by rotation, meaning that the data point no longer represent x- or y-values but a mixture of x- and y-values. The PCA is equivalent to the eigenvectors, of the covariance matrix, of the original data. The variance of each dimension in the PCA, is equivalent to eigenvalue of each eigenvector.</p>
<p>In the scatter plot, the hands appear to be evenly distributed on the first axis, whereas there are outliers on the second axis. Looking at the evenly distributed hands on the first axis, it is clear that the first axis influence how spread the fingers are.  <mark id="hover1">The hand to the far left</mark> , has the most distance between the fingers and the hand to the <mark id="hover2">far right</mark> has completely aligned fingers. The outliers <mark id="hover3">on the second axis</mark>, represent hands with uneven spacing between the fingers, where some fingers has wide distance while others are aligned. One outlier in the <mark id="hover4">top-left corner</mark> has space between the index-finger and the middle-finger and an outlier in the bottom has space between the ring-finger and the little-finger.</p>

<p>The following energy-graph show the cumulative sum of the first 40 normalized eigenvalues. The graph start with y = 0.64771 indicating that the first principal component hold roughly 65% of the data variance or energy. The second point on the graph show the sum of the variance of first and the second principal components, indicating that  82% of the data energy is represented in the first two principal components.</p>
